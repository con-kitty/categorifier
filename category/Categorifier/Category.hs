-- | This lifts `HasRep` into the target category.

--  __NB__: This is slightly hierarchy-specific. E.g., the base hierarchy doesn't require an
--          instance of this, and while concat has its own version of this, we need to use ours
--          because it has to tie into our `HasRep`.

-- | An interface for having something like function calls in your category. The default
--   implementation is basically a NOP, inlining any function calls, but if your category has some
--   way of handling abstraction, then you can provide a real implementation.
class ReferenceCat k a b where
  -- | The first parameter is a qualified Haskell identifier (although not necessarily one that
  --   exists in the source), and the input arrow is guaranteed to be the same as for any other call
  --   with the same first parameter. Be careful when mangling the identifier, to not introduce
  --   collisions.

  indirection = const id

-- | This allows a category to define a way to call functions that are defined externally
-- (as opposed to ReferenceCat which allows for internal function calls).
class ForeignFunCallCat k i a b where
  ffcall :: i -> Maybe (a -> b) -> a `k` b

-- | This class provides a backdoor for a user to provide a custom @findMaker@ entry
-- to interpret something that the user doesn't want to or cannot categorify.
--
-- We use @tag@ instead of @Proxy tag@ here, so that @findMaker@ doesn't have to
-- obtain the @Proxy@ tycon.
class NativeCat k (tag :: Symbol) a b where
  nativeK :: a `k` b

-- | This class is intended to lift `unsafeCoerce` into the target category @k@. This is needed for
--   converting various coercions.

--  __NB__: See https://github.com/conal/concat/issues/34 for more context on this.
