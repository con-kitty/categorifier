Defining novel interpretations of Haskell programs.

You probably want to look at the [plugin README](./plugin/README.md).

## Contributing

There are compatible [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/) environments in the repo to make it easy to build, test, etc. everything with consistent versions to help replicate issues.

This repo is all formatted using [Ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu) (included in the direnv and Nix environments), see the [usage notes](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu#usage) for how to best integrate it with your workflow. But don't let Ormolu get in the way of contributing - CI will catch the formatting, and we can help clean up anything.
