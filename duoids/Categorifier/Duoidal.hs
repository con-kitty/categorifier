-- | Provides duoidal operations on functors. This lets us easily mix and match "parallel" and
--  "sequential" operations on structures that have multiple viable `Applicative` instances, like
--  `Either` (`Data.Either.Validation.Validation`) and `System.IO.IO`
--  (`Control.Concurrent.Async.Concurrently`).
--
--   So, for example, when using this, you should ignore the existence of
--  `Data.Either.Validation.Validation`, and always work in `Either` (and `ExceptT`), then, using
--   these operators instead of the usual `Applicative` and `Monad` operators, you will have
--   behavior that correctly mixes the accumulation of errors with the monadic "first failure"
--   semantics. This should lawfully always do what you want, without running into the
--  "`Applicative` semantics must match `Monad` semantics" problem.
