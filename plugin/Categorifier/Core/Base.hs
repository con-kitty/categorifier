-- | The `Categorifier.Core.Hierarchy.baseHierarchy` can support most of categorification (`arr` is a
--   very powerful operation), but it doesn't provide all of the appropriate functions and some of
--   them are too complicated to encode directly in GHC Core. This module bridges the gap to make
--   the Core definitions more tractable.
