    There is no unfolding available for the identifier. It's possible that the
    identifier is an unspecialized type class method (methods never have
    unfoldings), a name used for `RebindableSyntax`, or that the unfolding
    somehow didn't get from the definition point to the module that called
   `categorify`. There are a few things you can check. Is the definition in the
    base library? If so, report this as a bug against the plugin. Does the
    definition expose an unfolding? The module containing the definition to be
    inlined should be compiled with `-fno-omit-interface-pragmas` (this is
    implied by `-O`). That _may_ be enough, but if not, try adding an
   `inlinable` pragma to the definition or compiling with
   `-fexpose-all-unfoldings` to make _every_ operation inlinable. It's also
    important that the module containing the call to `categorify` is compiled
    with `-fno-ignore-interface-pragmas` (also implied by `-O`). If the
    unfolding that's missing is for `$j` (GHC-internal join points), you may
    need to bump `-funfolding-creation-threshold` on the modules you're
    depending on. If there is still no unfolding available, please file an issue
    against the plugin.|]
